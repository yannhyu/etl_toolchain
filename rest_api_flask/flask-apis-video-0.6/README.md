Building Web APIs with Flask
============================

This repository contains the software that accompanies my O'Reilly training video [Building Web APIs with Flask](http://bit.ly/flaskapi).

[![Building Web APIs with Flask](http://img.youtube.com/vi/kO8zr-HO8GA/0.jpg)](http://bit.ly/flaskapi)

The class is structured around two example APIs:

- **orders**: a service that exposes an orders database to clients.
- **camera**: a service that allows clients to take and view pictures. This project is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi with a camera module, but can also be used on a regular computer with emulated camera hardware.

Instructions on how to install and use these examples is given in the appropraite segments of the class. Please visit the [product page](http://bit.ly/flaskapi) to see the contents of this video.
